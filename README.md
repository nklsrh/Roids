# Roids
A game inspired by the Atari classic 'Asteroids', built in Unity3D/C#

My goal is to write a clean and extensible framework so that:


1- I can match the game logic and feel of the classic 'Asteroids' game, including the behaviour patterns of the enemies and the difficulty progression.


2- It is easy to extend the gameplay either visually or through deeper mechanics such as powerups, stats, bosses, etc.


3- This can be used as a showcase of my coding ability, with correct use of C# features and Unity technology.


I will only be spending a short time on this project due to time restrictions, so I will keep this readme updated as I progress.




This project is being built with Unity 5.3.4, though you can probably make it work in any Unity 5.x installation.
